#' HW3: Bisection.
#'
#' In this exercise, you will implement a functional on your own: a root-finding algorithm called the bisection method.
#' For details, check the wikipedia page for 'Bisection Method': https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_method
#'
#' 1. Implement the bisection method using iteration and the scaffold given below.
#'    Argument `f` is the function of which we want to find the root.
#'    Argument `a` and `b` are two evaluated points.
#'    Argument `n` is the max number of iterations.
#'    Argument `tol` is the desired tolerence.

bisection <- function(f, a, b, n = 1000, tol = 1e-7) {
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Calculate midpoint
    m<-(a+b)/2
    # If the function equals 0 at the midpoint or the midpoint is below the desired tolerance, stop the
    # function and return the root.
    fm<-f(m)
    if(abs(fm)<tol) return(m)
    # If another iteration is required,
    # check the signs of the function at the points c and a and reassign
    # a or b accordingly as the midpoint to be used in the next iteration.
    else{
      fa<-f(a)
      if(fa*fm<0) b<-m
      else a<-m
    }
  }
}

#' 2. Modify the function `bisection` such that if the signs of the function at the evaluated points are the same, throw an error with message
#'    `"The signs of f evaluated at the endpoints are the same."`.
#'    Also if the max number of iterations is reached and no root has been found, throw an error with message `"Max number of iterations reached."`.

bisection <- function(f, a, b, n = 1000, tol = 1e-7) {
  # If the signs of the function at the evaluated points, a and b, are the same, throw an error.
  if(f(a)*f(b)>0) stop("The signs of f evaluated at the endpoints are the same.")
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Calculate midpoint
    m<-(a+b)/2
    # If the function equals 0 at the midpoint or the midpoint is below the desired tolerance, stop the
    # function and return the root.
    fm<-f(m)
    if(abs(fm)<tol) return(m)
    # If another iteration is required,
    # check the signs of the function at the points c and a and reassign
    # a or b accordingly as the midpoint to be used in the next iteration.
    else{
      fa<-f(a)
      if(fa*fm<0) b<-m
      else a<-m
      if(f(a)*f(b)>0) stop("The signs of f evaluated at the endpoints are the same.")
    }
  }
  
  # If the max number of iterations is reached and no root has been found, throw an error.
  stop("Max number of iterations reached.")
}
